-collect data with users = this is working OK
-change prediction horizon = this is working OK

-what we tested:
* adding noise with a prediction horizon, recognized changing z
* noise over goal, obstacle, actions
* z actually seems consistent in meaning... i.e., for all tasks,
	z = 0.0 is follow, z = -3.0 is ignore

-what needs to be done:
* more complex than just force agreement
