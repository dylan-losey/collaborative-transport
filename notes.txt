-what needs to be done:
* more complex than just force agreement
* outer RL loop


-predicting sequence using z = this is working OK

-collect data with users = this is working OK
-change prediction horizon = this is working OK
-adding noise in task = this is working OK
-confirming z is consistent in meaning = works OK
